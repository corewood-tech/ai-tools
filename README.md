# ai-tools

Felt cute. This is just a link repo for me to organize the stuff I want to use. Might delete later.

Went through and curated entries from the [Awesome List](https://github.com/slavakurilyak/awesome-ai-agents) for Agentic LLMs. I want a less-awesome list.

## Search and Data retrieval

### [serper](https://serper.dev/)

Google search API with a knowledge graph output -- pretty affordable.

### [stately](https://github.com/statelyai/agent/)

JS-based state management library. Probably won't use bc of JS but the state management is a great reference.

### [Adala](https://github.com/HumanSignal/Adala)

Python framework for data processing agents. I feel a little annoyed bc their example docs are tasks that ML / NLP can do very well.

### [AGiXT](https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT)

This python framework for agent automation management has a lot of features. This is going to be a rapid prototyping toolbox element for sure.

### [Replicate](https://replicate.com/)

Runs AI models -- basically infra and ML ops as a service (?). Supports many formats and runs a bunch of open source models.

### [Agency-swarm](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm)

This Python POC is a little simple, but the idea of creating a "digital agency" with "real world characters" is fun. I would like to see more abstraction and structured knowledge graphs/semantic compression.

### [ai-researcher](https://github.com/mshumer/ai-researcher)

This is worth showing how simple/stupid something can be and still be useful. It's just a jupyter notebook with "topics" and "subtopics."

### [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)

Python CLI to work with your repo, give it instructions, etc. Like CoPilot in the terminal.

### [Relevance AI](https://relevanceai.com/)

This is a lot of what I wanted to build, but the interface is very agentic-driven. I think a simpler, one-trick pony would have a separate market than AI Agent platforms. 

### [Autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)

This is the microsoft one. Written in NET and generates python, looks intended to be used with Python. This is one to keep an eye on.

### [Zep](https://www.getzep.com/)

This to me seems like the sauce. The tools to actually manage a knowldge graph & interact with the agent through the knowlege graph.
